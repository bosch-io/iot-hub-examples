# [Repo Archived]
This repo is archived because Bosch IoT Hub is no longer available as a standalone offering. IoT Hub is part of the Bosch IoT Device Management. If you are interested check out the [getting started guide for IoT Device Management](https://docs.bosch-iot-suite.com/device-management/Getting-started.html).

# Examples for Bosch IoT Hub Cloud Service
This repository contains examples for using the Bosch IoT Hub service in the cloud.

Bosch IoT Hub is part of the [Bosch IoT Suite](https://www.bosch-iot-suite.com), which is a cloud-based IoT platform provided by Bosch Software Innovations, as part of the Bosch Group.
Further background information regarding the platform is also available at the [Bosch Software Innovations](https://www.bosch-si.com/iot-platform/bosch-iot-suite/homepage-bosch-iot-suite.html) site.
